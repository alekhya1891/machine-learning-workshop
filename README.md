# Machine Learning Workshop 

This workshop was originally created and run by [ozzy18](https://github.com/ozzy18) and [lisafeets](https://github.com/lisafeets) for Women Who Code. 

This repository contains python code examples that are meant to help data science newbies learn the basics of creating machine learning models. 

## Getting Started

To run through the workshop labs, visit [this mybinder.org link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lisafeets/machine-learning-workshop/master).

The labs have been inspired/adapted/expanded from the ["Predicting Breast Cancer - Logistic Regression"](https://www.kaggle.com/leemun1/predicting-breast-cancer-logistic-regression) Kaggle post. Data is sourced from [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). 

Labs are meant to be run in order. Executing commands in order within each lab jupyter notebook will result in locally saved data sets that can be used in the proceeding lab. Datasets for each lab are also made available in the `/data_sets` folder.

Lab 1. Loading and cleaning breast cancer data (jupyter notebook).

Lab 2. Worksheet to practice choosing machine learning models for business problems (word doc)

Lab 3. Simple data processing and feature selection (jupyter notebook).

Lab 4. Model application, evaluation and tuning (jupyter notebook).
